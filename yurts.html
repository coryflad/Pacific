                    Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four
                    feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with
                    canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can
                    be opened.

                    Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt
                    and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes
                    electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower
                    and restroom facilites are located in the lodge.

                    Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes an plan to dress
                    for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also
                    helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
